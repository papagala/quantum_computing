# Introduction to Quantum Computing

Let this presentation serve as not-so-high-level introduction to Quantum Computing. Its considered (and probably will always be) a work in progress that might one day turn into something more than just a slide deck, for people interested on the topic.

Any comments are truly appreciated.
